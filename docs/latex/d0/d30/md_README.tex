The structure of this repository will follow the broadly be like that of Anahita, but with some changes.

To run this repository\+:\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md69}{}\doxysubsection{Create a catkin worspace following the guidelines given here}\label{md_README_autotoc_md69}

Official installation instructions are \href{http://www.irs.uji.es/uwsim/wiki/index.php?title=Installing_UWSim}{\texttt{ here}}. This should resemble source-\/based install, since we only want to change the core files, and not the external repositories. If you face any issue during building this project, please file an issue, or contact the admin. We are in development phase.

Install all dependency packages to run the repository. Currently there are no dependencies, apart from those required by uwsim.

You can build and install those packages from their respective sources or you can use the following command in Ubuntu 16.\+04 to install them. If you are building from source or using a different package manager, make sure you are building the melodic version of these packages to ensure maximum compatibility.
