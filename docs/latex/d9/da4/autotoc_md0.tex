The Simulink file \char`\"{}fsfb1.\+slx\char`\"{} contains a simple working model of full state feedback control (fsfb). It takes the velocity as input and gives the position as output. Position(output from model), velocity and position(from sensor) can be seen on the graphs and hence analysed.

Some issues are there regarding the inital postion which must be given to the state space model(the bot in simulator continously changes its position).So it must be rentered everytime from the data from graph.\+Also one can change the values in gain(-\/\+Kx) as per required.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Clone the repositiory and open the fsfb1.\+slx file in fsfb folder,in matlab.
\item Open the U\+W\+Sim simulator\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
roslaunch underwater\_vehicle\_dynamics UWSim\_g500\_dynamics.launch 
\end{DoxyCode}

\item Run the simulink model parallely
